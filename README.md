# chess
A barebones but workable chess GUI for experimentation with chess playing algorithms. chess uses tkinter and handdrawn pieces with click and drag movements. Functions are fairly obvious to use, most notable Board.getMoves(piece) where piece can be obtained from loc, i.e. ('a',1) on the board of the form Board.squares[loc].piece.

# Installation
1. cd $CHESS_DIRECTORY (whereever you want to put the files)
2. git clone https://github.com/alexrockhill/chess.git
